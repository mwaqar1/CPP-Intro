# WordStat Program

## Overview
This is a C++ program called 'WordStat,' which analyses text files to determine word frequencies. 

### Module Design and Integration
- **Structured Application:** Developed a modular structure for the application to facilitate easier scalability and maintenance. Modules included `cStrTools` for string handling, `Word` for processing word statistics, and `WordStat` as the main driver.
- **Namespace Management:** Applied the `sdds` namespace across different modules to avoid name conflicts and enhance code readability.

### C++ Programming
- **Advanced Language Features:** Utilized features such as namespaces, pointers, dynamic memory management, and exception handling to ensure robust application functionality.
- **File Handling:** Managed file I/O operations crucial for the word analysis tasks, ensuring data integrity and effective error handling.

### Compilation and Linking
- **Cross-platform Development:** Compiled and tested the application on both Windows using Visual Studio and Linux via the command-line g++ compiler, ensuring compatibility.
- **Build Automation:** Employed makefiles (Linux) and project settings (Visual Studio) to optimize the compilation and linking processes.

## Learning Outcomes

### Code Organization
- **Modular Coding:** Effectively organized source code into modules with separate header (.h) and implementation (.cpp) files, enhancing development ease and collaboration.
- **Header vs. Implementation:** Gained insights into the roles of header and implementation files in maintaining clarity and managing dependencies.

### Compilation Techniques
- **Compilation Safeguards:** Mastered the use of compilation safeguards like include guards to prevent multiple inclusions of header files.
- **Linking Modular Programs:** Acquired skills in linking multiple object files into a single executable, understanding dependencies and linking effects.

### Practical Skills
- **Debugging and Testing:** Enhanced debugging skills using tools like GDB and Visual Studio debugger, and developed comprehensive testing routines.
- **Performance Optimization:** Analyzed and optimized application performance by managing resources efficiently and optimizing algorithms.

## Problem Solving
- **Debugging and Optimization:** Employed systematic debugging and testing strategies to refine module functionalities, particularly the `getCString` function involving buffer management and input validation.

## Key Challenges and Resolutions
- **getCString Function Development:** Faced challenges in managing user input and buffer clearing, resolved through extensive debugging and iterative testing.

## Contributions to Code Maintainability
- The modular design facilitated easier updates and debugging, allowing each module to be independently developed and tested.

## Reflection
- This project reinforced my understanding of modular programming in C++, enhancing my ability to develop well-structured and maintainable software. It provided deep insights into practical C++ application development, preparing me for more complex tasks.
