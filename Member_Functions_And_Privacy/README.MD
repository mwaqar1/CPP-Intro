# Member Functions and Privacy in C++

## Project Overview
Engineered a comprehensive Train class in C++ to illustrate proficiency in class design, data encapsulation, and object-oriented programming. The project emphasized secure data handling, precise output formatting, and implementation of a safe empty state to enhance software reliability.

## Technical Details
- **Languages/Frameworks:** C++, Standard Template Library (STL)
- **Tools:** GCC Compiler, Visual Studio Code
- **Concepts:** Object-Oriented Programming, Data Encapsulation, Class Design, Data Validation

## Technical Skills Gained/Used
- **Class Design and Implementation:** Crafted a fully encapsulated class with private data members and member functions to manipulate and access data securely.
- **Advanced Data Handling:** Utilized C++ arrays, strings, and I/O libraries to manage data effectively, ensuring robust validation and formatting.
- **Debugging and Logic Enhancement:** Applied systematic debugging and problem-solving strategies to decipher complex requirements and implement functionalities that were not explicitly detailed in project guidelines.

## Achievements
- Developed critical features like dynamic passenger transfer and speed adjustments within operational limits, ensuring high data integrity and operational safety.
- Successfully handled edge cases in data manipulation, enhancing the software's robustness and reliability through comprehensive validation checks.

## Learning Outcomes
- **Class and Object Management:** Demonstrated the ability to define a class type, manage object instantiation, and ensure the privacy of data within a class structure.
- **State Management:** Mastered the use of member functions to query and alter the state of objects, implementing a safe empty state to handle invalid or incomplete data.
- **Output Precision:** Utilized C++ standard library facilities to format data outputs, improving the clarity and professionalism of console outputs.
- **Proactive Problem Solving:** Developed a keen sense for proactive problem-solving by identifying and implementing needed functionalities beyond basic requirements, such as nuanced passenger transfer logic in a real-world simulation.
- Enhanced understanding of real-world application development through practical implementation of theoretical concepts.
- Gained proficiency in C++ programming, focusing on modern practices and efficient code structuring for scalable solutions.
