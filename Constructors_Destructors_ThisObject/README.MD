## Constructors, Destructors, and the 'this' Object in C++

### Project Overview
Developed a comprehensive module named `CarInventory`  to demonstrate proficiency in utilizing constructors, destructors, and the 'this' object in C++. The project focused on object-oriented programming principles to manage a dynamic inventory of car entries.

### Technical Highlights

- **Class Design and Implementation:** Crafted the `CarInventory` class to encapsulate car details such as type, brand, model, year, inventory code, and price. Implemented robust input validation to ensure all data adheres to predefined standards.
  
- **Memory Management:** Engineered the class with dynamic memory allocation for string data and implemented a destructor to manage memory cleanup, preventing leaks.

- **Constructor Utilization:** Overloaded constructors to allow for multiple initialization scenarios ranging from default initialization to fully specified car details, enhancing flexibility.

- **Method Implementation:** Developed multiple public and private methods including `setInfo()` for updating car attributes, `printInfo()` for formatted output, and `isValid()` for entry validation.

- **Error Handling:** Introduced logical checks to validate data integrity across car entries and implemented functionalities to identify and manage duplicate records within the inventory system.

### Learning Outcomes

- Achieved a deep understanding of C++ class mechanics including default and overloaded constructors, and destructors.
- Enhanced skills in dynamic memory management and object-oriented design principles.
- Developed debugging and problem-solving skills through detailed analysis and implementation of a real-world simulation.
- Expanded the project scope by developing a secondary module named `Robots` to manage robot inventory for a control room scenario, demonstrating the ability to apply learned concepts across different contexts.
- Implemented complex functionalities such as multi-level validation and reporting systems, which improved my ability to build scalable and robust applications.

### Reflection
The project reinforced my capabilities in applying theoretical knowledge to practical challenges, particularly in areas requiring precise control over memory and data integrity. The second part of the workshop provided significant insights into modular design and advanced error handling, which were initially challenging but greatly enhanced my debugging skills.
