# Derived Classes and Custom Operators in C++

## Project Overview
In this project, I developed a hierarchical class structure in C++ consisting of a base class `Container` and a derived class `Pack`. The `Container` class encapsulates a container with a specific capacity in CCs, while the `Pack` class represents a container holding smaller units, such as cans or bottles. The project includes the implementation of custom input/output operators and various member functions to manage the container and its contents.

## Key Responsibilities and Achievements

### Class Inheritance
- Implemented a base class `Container` and derived class `Pack`.
- Demonstrated understanding of class inheritance by extending functionalities from `Container` to `Pack`.

### Member Function Shadowing
- Shadowed base class member functions in the derived class to provide specific implementations for `Pack`.
- Ensured access to shadowed member functions of the base class within the derived class.

### Custom Operators
- Developed custom input/output operators for both `Container` and `Pack` classes to facilitate user interactions via console.
- Implemented operator overloading for `+=` and `-=` to manage the addition and removal of content in the container.

### Error Handling and Validation
- Ensured robust error handling by validating input data and maintaining the integrity of container states.
- Utilized foolproof integer entry for secure user input and provided meaningful error messages.

### Class Methods and Attributes
- Created various public and protected methods to manage container attributes, including `setEmpty`, `capacity`, `volume`, `clear`, `print`, and `read`.
- Managed container content with attributes such as content, capacity, and content volume.

## Learning Outcomes
Successfully completing this project enabled me to:
- Apply object-oriented programming principles, specifically class inheritance and polymorphism.
- Implement and utilize custom operators to enhance class functionality.
- Effectively handle and validate user input to ensure data integrity.
- Describe and explain the implemented class hierarchy and its functionalities.
