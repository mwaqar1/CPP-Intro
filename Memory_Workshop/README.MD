# Memory in C++

## Project Overview
This comprehensive workshop focused on enhancing C++ programming skills, including advanced concepts such as function overloading, dynamic memory management, and the use of file scope variables. The project was structured into multiple parts, emphasizing hands-on learning, code reuse, and rigorous memory allocation techniques.

## Responsibilities
- **Function Overloading:** Developed multiple versions of functions to perform similar operations, thereby improving code clarity and reusability.
- **Dynamic Memory Management:** Implemented robust memory handling by dynamically allocating, reallocating, and deallocating memory for data structures, ensuring efficient memory usage and program stability.
- **Reference Utilization:** Leveraged references to modify and return values from functions, enhancing the program's ability to handle data efficiently.
- **Code Modularization:** Reused and integrated previously developed modules, demonstrating strong skills in maintaining and upgrading existing code bases.

## Key Achievements
- **Efficient Memory Management:** Mastered the techniques of dynamic memory management in C++ to handle complex data structures without memory leaks or segmentation faults.
- **Problem Solving:** Tackled challenging coding problems by implementing function overloads and managing memory operations meticulously, resulting in a stable and efficient application.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Compiler and Debugging Tools:** Utilized G++ with C++11 standards and Valgrind for memory leak detection to ensure robust application performance.
- **Development Environment:** Developed and tested the application in a Linux environment, employing tools like `diff` for output comparison.

## Learning Outcomes
Successfully completed the workshop with a deep understanding of dynamic memory allocation, function overloading, and the effective use of references in C++. Demonstrated the ability to handle complex programming scenarios, optimize resource management, and improve code efficiency and readability.
